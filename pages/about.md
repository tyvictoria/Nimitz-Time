## About Nimitz Family Photographs Collection
This site was made to organize the Nimitz Family Photographs into a visual timeline. Chester W. Nimitz was a member of the U.S. Navy from 1905 to his death in 1966, he was one of the first and only to reach the rank of Fleet Admiral, and is widely revered for his role in Japan's surrender during WW2 due to his command of the Pacific Fleet. The collection is made up of photographs during his time in the military as well as personal images of Chester W. Nimitz and his family. 


Through the dates supplied by the National Museum of the Pacific War, research based on identifiable locations or events, and visual comparison - the timeline has come together to *hopefully* provide a more accurate look at Chester W. Nimitz's history through images. Further, more extensive research would be needed to acurately attempt to date the entire collection or confirm the dates of certain photographs on the timeline.
