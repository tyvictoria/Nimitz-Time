## About Nimitz Family Photographs Collection

Nimitz was a very important member of the U.S. Navy, the one of the first and only to reach the rank Fleet Admiral, and widely considered the reason the U.S. beat Japan during WW2 due to his command of the Pacific Fleet. The collection is made up of photographs during his time in the military as well as personal images of Chester W. Nimitz and his family. 


Through the dates supplied by the National Museum of the Pacific War, research based on idetifying locations or events, and visual comparison - the timeline has come together to *hopefully* provide a more accurate look at Chester W. Nimitz's history through images.
